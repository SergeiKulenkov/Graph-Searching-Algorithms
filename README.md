# Graph-Searching-Algorithms

A compilation of graph searching algorithms using an adjacency list for graph representation:
* Depth and breadth first traversing for printing a graph from a given source vertex
* HasPath - checks if a path exists between given source and goal vertices
* CountConnectedComponents - gets a count of connected components in a graph
* GetLargestComponentSize - gets a size of the largest connected component in a graph
* GetShortestPathLength - gets the shortest path length between vertex A and vertex B
